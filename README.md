# GameOfLife
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced “players”, by creating patterns with particular properties. The rules of the game are listed in a seperate file named Rules under the same repository. A picture has been added under this repository to show the output of the code and how one frame of the game looks (File Name: GameOfLife.png)

This was the hardest project that I had worked on yet. It required high levels of analytical thinking, research and trial and error. I wanted to make this game to test out its unpredicatability and self-replication. What really intrigued me was how a zero-player game exitsed and I had to try it myself. Making this game has taught me a lot about how machine learning and coding work.
